# Kandinsky_Rectangle
This Project was inspired by the great and famous Artist Wassily Kandinsky.
He was a Pioneer of Abstract Art and wrote the important Book Point to 
Line to surface. In this Book he discussed the Elements of Abstract Art.
He discussed here the primary Shapes. This Shapes are the Rectangle the
Circle and the Triangle. In this Experiment I will explore the first Shape
the Rectangle. Rectangles are a connection between Kandinsky and Mondrian.
The Lines in Mondrians Images form betweem them Rectangles. In this Experiments
I have begun with a Set of empty Rectangles. So the Lines would been clear.
In an later Experiment I will come back to the Lines. Then I have expitrement
with Colors as filling of this Rectangles. This Colotrs get a little 
Transparency such they can better Interact with another. The last thing I
have done was in respect to Mondrian to restrict this colors to the four
primary Colors.
